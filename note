	  RollingUpdate	
		MaxSurge 
		  - Specifies the maximum number of pods the Deployment is allowed to create at one time. 
		  - You can specify this as a whole number (e.g. 5), or as a percentage of the total required number of pods 		
		         (e.g. 10%, always rounded up to the next whole number). 
		  - If you do not set MaxSurge, the implicit, default value is 25%.
		
		MaxUnavailable 
		  - specifies the maximum number of pods that are allowed to be unavailable during the rollout. 
		  - Like MaxSurge, you can define it as an absolute number or a percentage. 
	
Headless service 
	- If we don't need the default loadbalancing capability of services nor the single IP to service we use StatefullSet 
	- using Headless service we can get all the target pod ips, if we do nslookup.
	- It is created by sepcifying 'none' for ClusterIP
	- Headless service is usually used with StatefullSet controller.  


	- Headless service returns all the ips of the pods it is selecting.
	- headless service is created by specifying none for clusterIP 
	- headless service is usually used with statefulsets.
